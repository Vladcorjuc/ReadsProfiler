# ReadsProfiler

ReadsProfiler is a university project for Computer Networks (year 2 semester 1), the project consists of a server/client application responsible for storing, searching, and downloading books by certain categories(title, genre, author). One of the most difficult parts was to implement an efficient algorithm to suggest books to a user.


The app work like a shell with different commands:

The funniest part was the suggestion algorithm, for that I learned and used different algorithms like K-nearest-neighbours.
